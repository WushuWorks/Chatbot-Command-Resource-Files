# Command Data Files

This is a set of files that have lines of words that can be used with a chatbot to create randomized text commands by
using them as a source for things like single words or noun phrases.

## Usage 
You could make an attack command that could find two usernames and pull a line from ````attacks.txt```` and 
```damage types.txt``` and randomly
create a sentence like below.

```Ian licks Twicatity1 and deals 30 embarassment damage```
