admits that they stole their wallet and replaced it with an exact duplicate
throws up in front of them
had a crush on their best friend a while ago
dares them to try break dancing
challenges them to a rap battle
chokes up mid sentence and forgets what they were going to say
brags about how they watch Rick and Morty to impress them
talks about how sponges are more dangerous than rocks
tries to ask them out but instead asks how their day was
eats all their chips to impress them
runs away
dares them to give a 3-minute stand-up comedy routine
dares them to wear a kick-me sign for an hour
dares them to eat an entire pack of top ramen noodles
